# Number of Same-End Substrings

Can you solve this real interview question? Number of Same-End Substrings - You are given a 0-indexed string s, and a 2D array of integers queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri] indicates a substring of s starting from the index li and ending at the index ri (both inclusive), i.e. s[li..ri].

Return an array ans where ans[i] is the number of same-end substrings of queries[i].

A 0-indexed string t of length n is called same-end if it has the same character at both of its ends, i.e., t[0] == t[n - 1].

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = "abcaab", queries = [[0,0],[1,4],[2,5],[0,5]]
Output: [1,5,5,10]
Explanation: Here is the same-end substrings of each query:
1st query: s[0..0] is "a" which has 1 same-end substring: "a".
2nd query: s[1..4] is "bcaa" which has 5 same-end substrings: "bcaa", "bcaa", "bcaa", "bcaa", "bcaa".
3rd query: s[2..5] is "caab" which has 5 same-end substrings: "caab", "caab", "caab", "caab", "caab".
4th query: s[0..5] is "abcaab" which has 10 same-end substrings: "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab", "abcaab".


Example 2:


Input: s = "abcd", queries = [[0,3]]
Output: [4]
Explanation: The only query is s[0..3] which is "abcd". It has 4 same-end substrings: "abcd", "abcd", "abcd", "abcd".
