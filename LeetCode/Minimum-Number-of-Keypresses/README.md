# Minimum Number of Keypresses

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Number of Keypresses - You have a keypad with 9 buttons, numbered from 1 to 9, each mapped to lowercase English letters. You can choose which characters each button is matched to as long as:

 * All 26 lowercase English letters are mapped to.
 * Each character is mapped to by exactly 1 button.
 * Each button maps to at most 3 characters.

To type the first character matched to a button, you press the button once. To type the second character, you press the button twice, and so on.

Given a string s, return the minimum number of keypresses needed to type s using your keypad.

Note that the characters mapped to by each button, and the order they are mapped in cannot be changed.
